    To have the bounds of the paper, we need f to be normalized, and thus it should be bounded in [u, l].
    The formula only works with a centered Gaussian, so there is no need for G, only sigma.
    It is necessary to know the bound on the attacks epsilon (for now, I randomly put 0.1 for the 1D case).
    alpha is the confidence we want to have in the bound (0.999 for example).
    n is used to calculate f_smoothed and also for the quality of the bound because the larger n is, the more confident we are.
    The security expression follows from the weak law of large numbers.
